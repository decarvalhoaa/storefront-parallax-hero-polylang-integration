## About Polylang

Polylang allows you to create a bilingual or multilingual WordPress site. You
write posts, pages and create categories and post tags as usual, and then define
the language for each of them. The translation of a post, whether it is in the
default language or not, is optional.

* You can use as many languages as you want. RTL language scripts are supported.
  WordPress languages packs are automatically downloaded and updated.
* You can translate posts, pages, media, categories, post tags, menus, widgets...
* Custom post types, custom taxonomies, sticky posts and post formats, RSS feeds
  and all default WordPress widgets are supported.
* The language is either set by the content or by the language code in url, or
  you can use one different subdomain or domain per language
* Categories, post tags as well as some other metas are automatically copied
  when adding a new post or page translation.
* A customizable language switcher is provided as a widget or in the nav menu
* The admin interface is of course multilingual too and each user can set the
  WordPress admin language in its profile
